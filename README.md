This contains Python code that implements a web crawler and an indexer.

The portion of the web crawler I worked on with a team was CrawlerProject2\spacetime\python\applications\search\crawler_frame.py.

Specifically, we worked on process_url_group and is_valid functions, as well as, writing analytics out to CrawlerAnalytics\search\combinedAnalytics.txt

As for the indexer, we implemented all of the Python code in Indexer\index.py
