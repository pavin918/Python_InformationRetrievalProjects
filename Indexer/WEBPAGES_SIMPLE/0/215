 Chimera 2.0 Tutorial: Chimera CLASSPATH setup for Windows NT<body>
 

<h2>Setting CLASSPATH in Windows NT to include chimera.jar</h2>

  
This section will explain how to set the CLASSPATH environment variable
to include chimera.jar. CLASSPATH is used by the Java interpretor to
determine where it looks for Java byte-code.  Since the server programs 
that make up Chimera 2.0 are in chimera.jar, you need to set CLASSPATH
to the location of chimera.jar.
 

<h3>Setting the CLASSPATH Environment Variable</h3>

  Follow the following steps to access the area in NT where the
environment variables are located.
 

   Open the Control Panel.
           

       Double click the System icon from the Control Panel window.
           
	The Systems Properties window should appear.  

       Click on the Environment tab.  This will display the
        information about the environment variables used.
           
	Add the variable CLASSPATH and type in the path to the location of 
	chimera.jar in the value field. 
	(Note: This image does not show chimera.jar being added 
	to the CLASSPATH variable.  Be sure to type in the proper path
	for your system.)
    You now have the chimera.jar file set for your Java interpretor.
