 Process Isolation<body>

 <h1>Process Isolation</h1> 
     <h2>Processes and reconfigured hardware must be  isolated to enable robust, extensible systems
</h2>
    <h2>Goal: Develop an Architectural Framework for Safe Adaptation
</h2>
  Formalize OS notion of process and access control
  Identify control points in base and adaptive hardware for access control 
  Synthesize reverse maps for the OS protection constraints
  Isolation hardware
  Fault mapping to OS semantics (meaningful faults to software) 
    Example: privilege level control, control register access, address generation, special instructions
