 Principle: Be Specific<body>

 <h1>Principle: Be Specific</h1> 
       <h2>In real life, holistic judgments are vague:
</h2>

      �I trust my spouse� � for what? 
  �I trust my Bank� � that�s not how they see it
        <h2>General-purpose Web tools frustrate:
</h2>

      Web servers deal in bags of bits between machines
    Not easy to distinguish a medical record file
  Not easy to identify the actual user
    Web client interfaces don�t understand either
    �Do you want to submit this data unencrypted� - swat!
    Underlying OS security can thwart limits
    Sandboxing mobile code, redistribution limits

   <strong> Notes: </strong> 
       

Be specific about the level of trust, too. </body>
