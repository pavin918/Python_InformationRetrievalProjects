 Semantic Retention in AMRM machines<body>

 <h1>Semantic Retention in AMRM machines</h1> 
     <h2>Semantic retention techniques will be used to:
</h2>
  Carry out footprint memory analysis.
  Direct cache configuration (e.g., Block size).
  Cache-line configuration. 
  Better mapping of data to memory 
  E.g., Mapping irregular structures for efficient access based on application access pattern - e.g., store tree nodes in DF order.
    Better mapping through improved parallelism/code-reordering/prefetching.
