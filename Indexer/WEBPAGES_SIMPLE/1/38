      <h3>
<b>  I have moved to Arizona State University. </b>
<b>Please visit me   there  </b>
</h3>

 

My research interests lie in the broad area of <b> Software for 
Embedded Systems</b> with a particular focus on the
processor architecture - compiler boundary. 
I have developed a software toolkit for automatic Compiler-in-the-Loop
exploration of Embedded Systems. 
My other interests are in CAD algorithms and high-level synthesis.
