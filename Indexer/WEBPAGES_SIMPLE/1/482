 Bayesian Inference in the Presence of Determinism 

 David Larkin and Rina Dechter 

 
<b>Abstract</b> 
In this paper, we consider the problem of performing inference on Bayesian networks
which exhibit a substantial degree of determinism. We improve upon the determinismexploiting
inference algorithm presented in [4], showing that the information brought to
light by constraint propagation may be exploited to a much greater extent than has
been previously possible. This is con.rmed with theoretical and empirical studies.
