<b>   Corporate Affiliates and Recruiting 
  </b> An advisory board of industry representatives and a CEO advisory board meet regularly with ICS Chair  <b>Debra J. Richardson</b>  <b>to provide input on our education programs and to discuss strategic directions for ICS. The </b> <b>ICS Partners</b> <b> group was formed to help companies recruit ICS students and form research ties with ICS faculty. ICS will graduate 175 B.S. students, 15 M.S. students, and 20 Ph.D. students in 1999. </b> 
 A  <b>research park</b> <b> on the campus provides an ideal location for high-tech companies interested in interacting with the university. Employees from companies in the research park may walk to campus to attend seminars and UCI students can easily walk to companies for internships. Information about several matching funds programs to encourage corporations to sponsor research projects in ICS is available on the ICS </b> <b>Corporate and Community Relations</b> <b> webpage.</b>
