 Victim Caching<body>

 <h1>Victim Caching</h1> 
     <h2>VC useful in case of conflict misses, long sequential reference streams. Prevent sharp fall off in performance when WSS is slightly larger than L1.
</h2>
    <h2>Estimate WSS from the structure of the RM such as the size of the strongly connected components (SCCs)
</h2>
    <h2>MORPH data-path structure supports addition of a parameterized victim/stream cache. The control logic is synthesized using CAD tools.
</h2>
    <h2>Victim caches provide 50X the marginal improvement in hit rate over the primary cache.</h2>
