   Use Type-1 Fonts in PDF Papers    Chen

Recently many publishers have strict requirements about the fonts used
in camera-ready paper submissions.  Specifically, they require authors
to substitute Adobe Postscript Type 1 fonts for any bitmap fonts
(e.g., Postscript Type 3 bitmapped fonts, PCL fonts, MacOS bitmap
fonts, Windows vector (outline) fonts). Being the Proceedings Chair of
 ACM PODS 2005 , I
set up the  instructions  for
camera-ready submissions.  In the process of editing the proceedings,
 I saw many common problems for authors to meet such a requirement.
I wrote this page so that it may benefit other authors with similar
problems.  As always, comments are very welcome.

<h2>Font Requirements</h2>

The following are some general font requirements by ACM.
 Authors should substitute Adobe Postscript Type 1 fonts for any
bitmap fonts (e.g., Postscript Type 3 bitmapped fonts, PCL fonts,
MacOS bitmap fonts, Windows vector (outline) fonts). Bitmapped fonts
display poorly on screen in PDF files and sometimes cause printing
problems.  Whenever possible, please substitute Type 1 Postscript
fonts for Type 3 fonts in LaTEX files, then generate PS or PDF.  LaTEX
FILES: PDFs generated from LaTEX files generally do not display well
on screen because the fonts that are generated from LaTEX for the PDFs
are bitmap images. 




   
<h2>Why Such Requirements?</h2>

The simple reason for having these requirements is to make sure your
PDF papers can be displayed nicely when they are browsed by people.
Type 1 fonts are displayed much  better than Type 3 fonts, even
though the paper in Type 1 fonts may print the same as the one in Type
3 fonts.  Click  this page  to see
good examples to illustrate the quality difference of different
fonts.
I copied their examples here. Here are examples from pdf files viewed
in Acrobat Reader at 400% zoom.

<h2>How do you tell what fonts your pdf file is using?</h2>

When you open your PDF file using  Adobe Acrobat Reader ,
go to "File --&gt; Document Properties --&gt; Fonts" to see the fonts used
in your PDF file.   Make sure to click "List All Fonts" to see all the
fonts.  You may also bring up this box by typing "Ctrl+Alt+F".  The
following is an example. 

    

   
<h2>LaTeX  dvips  command to produce PDF files using Type 1 fonts only</h2>

I used the following dvips command (in MiKTeX) to produce PDF files
using Type 1 fonts only: 

     dvips -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -j0 mypaper.dvi -o mypaper.ps  
 
Check  this
link  for more information about the options.

    
<h2>Common Problems</h2>

If your PDF file includes type 3 fonts, you may check the following to
get rid of such fonts.

  
<h3>1. Use the right  dvips  option</h3>

Make sure to use the right options in the  dvips 
command. Try the following:  
     dvips -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -j0 mypaper.dvi -o mypaper.ps   

  
 <h3>2. Missing fonts</h3>

If your LaTeX environment doesn't have all the necessary fonts used by
your file, when you use  dvips , it will produce a file called:

    missfont.log   

Check if this file exists.  If it does, it means your environment
misses some fonts, and needs to install them.  Check  this
link  for more information.

  
 <h3>3. Type 3 fonts from figures (xfig)</h3>

Often type-3 fonts are introduced from figures.  In particular, I
found that eps files produced by xfig can introduce type-3 fonts.  In
particular, according to  http://leon.bottou.com/nips/ , 
 
    * xfig "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.
      Use "solid" shapes instead.
 

As an example, the following two xfig files both draw the same circle.
The file "pattern.fig" uses a "patterned" shape to draw the circle,
and its corresponding "pattern.pdf" is using a type-3 font.  The file
"solid.fig" uses a "slide" shape to draw the circle, and its
corresponding "slide.pdf" is not introducing any type-3 font. 

A circle using a patterned shape (type-3 font introduced)
    pattern.fig 
    pattern.eps 
    pattern.pdf 
   A circle using a solid shape (type-3 font not introduced)
    solid.fig 
    solid.eps 
    solid.pdf
